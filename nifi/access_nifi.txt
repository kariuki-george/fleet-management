
## Nifi
- Trying to access nifi from the docker desktop application will throw an error since the docker 
compose application fowards you to http://localhost:8443/nifi.
- Since nifi has been comfigured to only use the HTTPS security protocol, access nifi from the link below
- https://localhost:8443/nifi
- A fix will be provided later.
